## Overview

- Run `bun run check` every time before finishing a code change.
- Always use const and arrow functions for defining functions.
- `children` props will type as `Snippet` (import type { Snippet } from 'svelte')
- Other props must named as `...props`
- Order component props from {...props}, class={classes}, other props.
